Remove from heat and stir vigorously for 1 minute more to release steam, then beat in 3 eggs, 1 at a time, beating until incorporated after each addition. Stir in Swiss cheese, 1 tablespoon parmesan, and mustard, then spread dough with dampened hands into a buttered 9-inch pie plate. Create a 6-inch-wide hole in center by pulling dough toward edge of pie plate, then mound filling in hole. Push dough 1 inch up sides of filling, leaving top of filling exposed. Lightly beat remaining egg and brush some over dough (reserve remainder for another use), then sprinkle with remaining tablespoon parmesan. Bake pie until dough is puffed and golden, about 40 minutes, then cut 4 slits with a small knife around side of dough to release steam and bake 10 minutes more. Let pie stand 5 minutes before serving.",

Place the bones, skin, and trimmings back in the simmering stock pot and continue to simmer. Add the mushrooms and garlic to the pan with the chopped vegetables and turn up the heat to brown all the ingredients, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook gently for a minute. Strain the stock into a measuring cup and measure out 3 1/3 cups (you can freeze any extra). Add nearly all of the stock and the soy sauce to the pan of vegetables, stirring it in slowly until it comes back to a simmer and thickens. Add a little more stock if it is still too thick- it should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Chop the parsley leaves and add to the pan, along with the chicken.

Transfer to bowl of ice water to cool. Drain. Line microwave-safe plate with plastic wrap. Overlap enough potato rounds (about 12) on plastic to form 4-inch round. Microwave on high until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer potato galette to baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining potatoes and 3 teaspoons oil to form total of 4 galettes. (Reduced stock, asparagus, and galettes can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add leek. Cover and cook until just tender, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add crab, cream, and chives; simmer to heat through. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Cover to keep warm. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp; sauté until just opaque in center, 3 minutes. Add asparagus; toss to heat through. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in another large skillet over medium-high heat. Add galettes and cook until crisp and brown, 1 1/2 minutes per side; transfer 1 galette to each of 4 plates. Bring reduced stock to simmer. Remove from heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter; whisk just until melted. Top potato galettes with crab mixture. Arrange shrimp atop crab. Surround with asparagus. Spoon stock over.",

        "instructions": "In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, melt 3/4 cup of the sugar, stirring often, until it takes on a nice sandy color and is a smooth liquid, 10 to 15 minutes. Quickly add the fruit and stir to coat with the sugar; this will prevent the sugar from caramelizing any further and/or burning. Cook until the fruit is soft, about 10 minutes or so, depending on which fruit you're using and its ripeness. Transfer the caramelized fruit to a blender. Add the miso and process to a smooth purée. Set aside. Fill a large bowl or pan with ice and water. Place a large, clean bowl in the ice bath and fit the bowl with a fine-mesh strainer. In a large, heavy-bottomed, nonreactive saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream and milk and cook, stirring occasionally, until hot but not boiling. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining 1 cup sugar until well blended. Remove the cream mixture from the heat. Slowly pour about half of the hot cream mixture into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Transfer the yolk mixture back to the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture and return it to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula and being sure to scrape the bottom of the saucepan so it doesn't scorch, until the liquid begins to steam and you can feel the spatula scrape against the bottom of the pan, about 2-3 minutes. Remove the custard from the heat. Add the fruit-miso mixture and stir to mix completely. Pour the custard through the strainer into the clean bowl you set up in the ice bath. Let cool, stirring occasionally. Taste for sweetness; add a little more sugar if needed. When the custard has totally cooled, cover the bowl tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or preferably overnight. When you are ready to freeze the custard, transfer it to an ice cream maker and spin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eat immediately, or transfer to an airtight container, cover, and freeze for up to 1 week.",

(Alternatively, fillet may be roasted in an oiled roasting pan in a preheated 500°F. oven approximately the same amount of time.) Transfer fillet to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium; simmer, occasionally mashing some chickpeas with the back of a spoon or a potato masher, until sauce is thickened, 15-20 minutes. Fold in spinach; simmer for flavors to meld, adding more broth by 1/4-cupfuls if too thick, 8ñ10 minutes. Pour oil into a large heavy skillet to a depth of 1/8\" (about 1/4 cup). Heat until oil begins to shimmer. Crack 2 eggs into hot oil, spacing apart. Using a large spoon, carefully baste whites (not yolks) with oil until whites are set and edges are crunchy, lacy, and golden brown, 2-3 minutes (do not turn). Season eggs with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining 2 eggs. Spoon chickpea stew into bowls and top each with a fried egg.",
